Python project related to CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) IDs, we need to specify the project or provide more information

If we have a Python project related to CVE IDs, its dependencies would be the specific Python libraries and other resources the project requires to run properly. These dependencies would be typically listed in a `requirements.txt` file or, if the project uses a packaging tool like Poetry or Pipenv, in their respective configuration files (`pyproject.toml` for Poetry and `Pipfile` for Pipenv).
