                     Mirmusa’s Self Assessment

Navigating this Python project, I drew heavily from my backend development background. I found Python's extensive libraries and frameworks, particularly Flask and Django, a boon for rapid development. However, challenges arose in optimizing database queries and ensuring smooth data flow. Additionally, integrating with the front-end required constant collaboration to maintain data consistency. Although I initially struggled with caching mechanisms, with research and peer feedback, solutions emerged. The project underlined the importance of scalability considerations and proactive communication with the front-end team. It reaffirmed my belief in Python as a robust backend tool and honed my skills further in problem-solving and system design.
